# Coding-Challenge-12
This is Coding Challenge #12 for ISM 3232. This challenge is an interactive web-based drawing tool for a small design company that allows users to choose between drawing lines, rectangles, or circles, select a color, draw by clicking and dragging the mouse, and clear the canvas with a button.
